# Vizier DB - Web User Interface

This repository contains the code for the Vizier DB Web User Interface. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
For more information on how to perform common tasks [refer to this guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

Vizier is a new powerful tool to streamline the data curation process. Data curation (also known as data preparation, wrangling, or cleaning) is a critical stage in data science in which raw data is structured, validated, and repaired. Data validation and repair establish trust in analytical results, while appropriate structuring streamlines analytics.

Vizier makes it easier and faster to explore and analyze raw data by combining a simple notebook interface with spreadsheet views of your data. Powerful back-end tools that track changes, edits, and the effects of automation. These forms of provenance capture both parts of the exploratory curation process - how the cleaning workflows evolve, and how the data changes over time.
