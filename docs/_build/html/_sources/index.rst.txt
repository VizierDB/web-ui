Welcome to Vizier DB - WebUser Interface's documentation!
=========================================================

**Vizier** is a new powerful tool to streamline the data curation process. Data curation (also known as data preparation, wrangling, or cleaning) is a critical stage in data science in which raw data is structured, validated, and repaired. Data validation and repair establish trust in analytical results, while appropriate structuring streamlines analytics.

**Vizier** makes it easier and faster to explore and analyze raw data by combining a simple notebook interface with spreadsheet views of your data. Powerful back-end tools that track changes, edits, and the effects of automation. These forms of provenance capture both parts of the exploratory curation process - how the cleaning workflows evolve, and how the data changes over time.

**Vizier** is a collaboration between the **University at Buffalo**, **New York University**, and the **Illinois Institute of Technology**.
