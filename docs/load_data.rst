Load Dataset
-------------

Continuing with our example of the credit_card project, we show here the methods of uploading data.

First at all come back to the initial page of Vizier. If the data that you want to clean is currently stored in CSV files, these files have to be uploaded to the file server. If you want to upload your own data file, then go under the **Files** Tab.
